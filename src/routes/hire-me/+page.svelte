<h2>Hire Me</h2>

<p>
	Since January 2024, I've run a sole proprietorship that combines my years of experience in (systems) programming and design as highlighted on my <a href="/resume">resume</a>
	and <a href="/projects">projects showcase</a>. I'd be excited to help you with a wide-ranging assortment of projects including but not limited to
	websites/web applications, low-level libraries, compilers, and technical writing.
</p>

<p>
	If you're interested, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:auguste@augustera.me">auguste@augustera.me</a> and I'll happily give you a quote depending on the scope of your project.
	Please let me know if you represent a non-profit or a not-for-profit open-source project.
</p>
