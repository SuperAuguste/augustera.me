#### Created [Zig SCIP Indexer](https://github.com/zigtools/scip-zig) for Sourcegraph

Drawing from my work on ZLS, I developed a Protocol Buffers encoder and decoder from scratch in Zig, reimplemented ZLS semantic analysis logic to produce SCIP data with the aforementioned Protobuf code, and uploaded that data to Sourcegraph's Code Intelligence platform to provide precise Zig code navigation, all while being a full-time student.

I discussed my work on [Sourcegraph Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKMTzVgvf60) alongside CTO Beyang Liu, OSS Manager Justin Dorfman, and Zig Software Foundation VP of Community Loris Cro.
