#### Created [Software You Can Love Vancouver 2023](https://softwareyoucanlove.ca/) Website

When Matt Knight of the Zig Embedded Group reached out looking for a website for the annual defacto Zig conference Software You Can Love, I couldn't say no.

I began by sitting down with Matt and brainstorming themes and designing branding, signage, and a simple design system. I then proposed a website design conforming with the design system, and implemented it from scratch, even rewriting the previous Hugo-based setup from the ground up to fit our needs.
