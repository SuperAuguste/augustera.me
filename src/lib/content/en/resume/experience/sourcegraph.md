#### Code Intel and Cody Intern at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com)

I brought my compiler frontend knowledge to the excellent Code Intelligence team at Sourcegraph, where I contributied to [SCIP](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip) indexers such as [scip-typescript](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip-typescript) and worked closely with TJ, my mentor, to create new zero-config code intelligence tooling and empower teams company-wide on its use.

I then joined the Cody team where I pioneered [Cody Agent](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody/tree/main/agent) for cross-editor support which contributed heavily to securing of substantial Cody customers using editors other than VSCode. Later, I designed and implemented a first-of-its kind compiler-based LLM context solution.

I also programmed and deployed a [Zendesk Discord integration](https://github.com/sourcegraph/zendesk-discord-integration) for the customer support team.
