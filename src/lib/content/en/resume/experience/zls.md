#### Creator and Maintainer of the [Zig Language Server](https://github.com/zigtools/zls) (ZLS)

While learning Zig in 2020, I found myself repeatedly running into situations where if good editor tooling had existed, my experience as a new Zig user would've been significantly improved - so I created the editor tooling I wanted! Now, the Zig Language Server is a true intellisense tooling powerhouse that helps thousands of Zig developers daily, including developers at companies like [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [TigerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com/).

Over the years, I've managed and collaborated with a team of four incredibly talented co-maintainers, communicated about ZLS (e.g. [SYCL Vancouver 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npb1rAYHpw8), [Sourcegraph Promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_7o3yroYy4)) to help ZLS and Zig adoption, [raised funds](https://opencollective.com/zigtools) to pay fellow maintainers, designed systems in ZLS such as [ZLS' DocumentScope](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/blob/master/src/DocumentScope.zig), and maintained communication with critical players in the Zig community to continually support their usecases and improve ZLS.
