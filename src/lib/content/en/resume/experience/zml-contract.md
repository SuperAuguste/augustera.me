#### Systems Programming Contracting at [ZML](https://zml.ai)

I joined ZML's team as an early phase contractor, taking on the role of "founding engineer," combining years of experience in systems programming with Zig with new knowledge of MLIR and Bazel. I'm designing an ML inference API that balances the Zig Zen and the past user experiences of a primarily Pythonic audience while advancing objectives crucial to stakeholders and investors like decentralized execution.

To ensure the API I'm designing will meet user needs, I've learned, from scratch, the entire modern PyTorch inference stack. I even implemented [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec), the Facebook audio coding model, in our framework and took the insights I drew from the experience to the rest of the team to improve our API.
