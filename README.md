## Design + Development

### Menu

I've always wanted to design and develop a vertical line-based menu but thought it to be inconvenient, especially on mobile. But with an hour of tinkering in my design software of choice and the power of CSS Grid, the inconvience and non-responsiveness of the line based concept disappeared.

I first designed the actual vertical menu first, then added the video backgrounds and integrated the blue hover, and finally added the control bar on the left for convenience at the end.

## TODO

* Replace placeholder videos on menu
* Actually add content
