Welcome to my blog!
---

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time.

Recently, my urge to blog was reinvigorated when Loris Cro, VP of Community at the Zig Software Foundation and an awesome acquaintance, briefly discussed the behind the scenes work of [his fantastic blog](https://kristoff.it/blog) and the numerous advantages blogs, more specifically technical blogs, can bring to their authors as well as the communities they serve overall.

Implementation details relating to this side-project are flaky; perhaps this blog will serve as a d√©potoir of rants and yak shaving, maybe it'll be a hub of haute political debate regarding ever-pertinent topics of daily life in society such as whether or not pineapple belongs on pizza - this blog could even contain *educational* and *informative* content, which would be shockingly off-brand for me. Only time will tell.
