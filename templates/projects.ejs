        <p>
            Over the years, I've accumulated quite the list of projects.
            Here you'll find a collection of my favorite projects that combine my passion for programming and design.
            From websites to developer tooling, I love creating functional and visually appealing experiences that solve problems and bring joy to users.
            Take a look around and let me know what you think!
